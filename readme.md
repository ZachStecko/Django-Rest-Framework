# Coffee Order Application using Django-Rest-Framework

###### This project uses the django-rest-framework showing multiple apps in the project communicating with one another.

    • The user places an order for coffee under the coffees app which adds the coffee to a list of all the other coffee orders.

    • A user can then go and view the list of all the requested coffee orders and then choose which coffee requests they want to add to an official order.

    • Once the official order has been made a user can navigate to see the summary of the order, the date and time it was placed, and the total price of the order.
